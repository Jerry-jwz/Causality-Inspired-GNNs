# Causality-Inspired-GNNs

This repository curated list of Causality-Inspired Graph Neural Network (CIGNNs) works and relevant resources discussed in our survey 'A Survey on Trustworthy Graph Neural Networks: From A Causal Perspective'. This survey reviews the recent progress of incorporate causal learning into GNNs to improve their trustworthiness. A preprint version can be found at [Link](URL).
